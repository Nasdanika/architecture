NASDAF Maven plug-in for generating documentation from NASDAF and other Nasdanika models. 
Extensible (dependencies, configuration) to support more models and perhaps resource factories, adapter factories, URI handlers and "resource set configurator" classes.

Perhaps also a plug-in for ecore documentation generation.
