[Azure virtual machine scale sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced [Virtual Machines](VirtualMachine.html). 
The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.
