[Azure managed disks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview) are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with [Azure Virtual Machines](VirtualMachine.html). Managed disks are like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized. With managed disks, all you have to do is specify the disk size, the [disk type](DiskType.html), and provision the disk. Once you provision the disk, Azure handles the rest.
