Azure Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an [Azure region](Region.html) and offer high availability to protect your applications and data from datacenter failures. 
Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

The physical separation of availability zones within a region protects apps and data from facility-level issues.
Zone-redundant services replicate your apps and data across Azure Availability Zones to protect from single points of failure.
